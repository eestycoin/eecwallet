        Honestum Est – these are Latin words and they mean “Beautiful Life”. What kind of life can be called beautiful? For some people, pure water, food and shelter are enough for beautiful life. For some, however, a beautiful life means a job, apartment or
        house, car, family and children, and a holiday trip once a year. But some people want a lot more. Many of you who already think you have a beautiful life, have your own formula for getting there. But for those who are still curious, there are
        eight important STEPS: Know yourself. Define what a “beautiful life” means to you. Take up activities to have a beautiful life. Assess where you are in this process. Adjust your expectations. Meditate, pray and be grateful for what you have. Love
        yourself LIVE YOUR BEAUTIFUL LIFE!
